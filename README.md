# GMR App Team

## Pull Request Template

This repo contains the PR template for all repos in the `GMR-Internal` org. This is meant to be a _guideline_ and not every item here will apply to every repository. Use your best judgement.

To complete PRs:

1) Add a short summary for a title, prefixed with the story number.
2) Replace any "comment blocks" (prefixed with `>`) with the information described in them.
3) "Check" appropriate check boxes by putting an `x` between `[ ]`
4) Add additional descriptions/context as necessary.

### Customizing the template per repository

If you would like to customize it for a specific repo, you can copy `pull_request_template.md` to the repo's `./github` folder on the **main** branch.
Note that if a repo has its own template, changes to this template will not automatically be reflected in those.
